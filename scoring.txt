Scoring


To score your combination of 5 dice, you click one of the 13 boxes, or write it on the scorecard (scoresheet). There are two sections to the score table - the Upper Section and the Lower Section.

Once a box has been scored, it cannot be scored again for the rest of the game (except the Yahtzee category), so choose wisely.



Upper Section Scoring


If you score in the upper section of the table, your score is the total of the specified die face.
So if you roll:
5 - 2 - 5 - 6 - 5 and score in the Fives category, your total for the category would be 15, because there are three fives, which are added together.
If the One, Three or Four Categories were selected for scoring with this roll, you would score a zero.
If placed in the Two or Six category, you would score 2 and 6 respectively.



Lower Section Scoring


In the lower scores, you score either a set amount, or zero if you don't satisfy the category requirements.

3 and 4 of a kind For 3 of a kind you must have at least 3 of the same die faces. You score the total of all the dice. For 4 of a kind you would need 4 die faces the same.

Small and Large Straight A Straight is a sequence of consecutive die faces, where a small straight is 4 consecutive faces, and a large straight 5 consecutive faces.
Small straights score 30 and a large 40 points.
So if you rolled:
2 - 3 - 2 - 5 - 4
you could score 30 in small straight or 0 in large straight.





Full House A Full House is where you have 3 of a kind and 2 of a kind. Full houses score 25 points.
i.e.:
3 - 3 - 2 - 3 - 2
would score 25 in the Full House category.
